Performance recommendation engine for the Performance Auto-Tune feature.

Single entry point: `recommend_settings(hw)` takes the dict from
`hardware_detect.detect_hardware()` and returns a dict of settings
to apply to wgp_config.json. Pure function — no side effects, no
imports beyond stdlib, easy to unit test.

The recommendation table mirrors the design in
`memory/project_performance_auto.md`. Rationale lives there; this
module is just the lookup.

Coefficient policy (decided 2026-05-02):
- 0.80 across all tiers with VRAM ≥ 12 GB
- 0.70 for VRAM < 12 GB
- We do NOT bump above 0.80 even on 24 GB cards. Real-world data
  (user's RTX 4090) shows 0.80 sometimes OOMs on heavy workloads;
  going higher would be actively harmful.

#   - Multi-stage pipeline overhead (intermediate latents stay
#     resident across passes)
#
# Real-world data (RTX 4090, 24 GB):
#   LTX-2.3 dist 1.1, 720p × 20s, no LoRAs:
#     - 1 stage:  ~19 GB peak (matches 0.80 cap)
#     - 2 stage:  ~21 GB peak (over the cap by ~2 GB)
#     - + 3 LoRAs: 23.7+ GB peak (OOM territory)
#
# This helper computes a per-job effective coefficient that accounts
# for both factors, so the user's auto-tuned base can stay sensible
# (0.80) while real jobs get a tighter cap when they actually need it.

# Per additional pipeline stage at the BASELINE 720p resolution:
# ~2 GB of intermediate latent memory stays resident on top of stage
# 1's working set. Empirical from RTX 4090 stage-2 measurements at
# 720p; the actual per-stage cost scales with output resolution since
# stage 2 (refinement / upscale) operates at full output resolution
# and its activation peak grows linearly with pixel count.
#
# Calibrated 2026-05-15: a 20s × 1080p × 2-stage × no-LoRA job on
# RTX 4090 OOM'd on stage 2 with the previous flat-2.0 GB penalty
# (effective coef = 0.513 = 12.3 GB cap). Scaling pass overhead by
# the resolution factor (1080p = 2.25× of 720p baseline) raises the
# 1080p penalty to 4.5 GB, dropping the effective coef to ~0.41 (cap
# ~9.8 GB). That triggers more aggressive offload at stage 2 and
