        # most chat-app interactions never approach. LM Studio's
        # baseline `repeat_penalty: 1.1` over a 64-token window was

        # still collapsed into single-suffix repetition like

        # Stack:
        #   - temperature: 0.7 (down from 0.8) — less random sampling
        #     starves the cascade of variation that lets it rebuild
        #     after the penalty knocks it down
        #   - top_p: 0.92 (down from 0.95) — tighter nucleus
        #   - top_k: 40, min_p: 0.05 — LM Studio standard
        #   - repeat_penalty: 1.15 (up from 1.1) — stronger logit
        #     divisor against repeated tokens
        #   - repeat_last_n: 256 (default is 64) — wider penalty
        #     window protects against word-spaced repetition that
        #     can build up across multi-sentence stretches
        #   - frequency_penalty: 0.1 — OpenAI-style accumulating
        #     penalty as belt-and-suspenders against the same token
